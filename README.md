# detection-semaphore-code dada

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project is a Real-Time Semaphore Gesture Recognition App using MediaPipe Pose, TensorFlow MobileNetV2, FastAPI (Python) for the backend, and Next.js (React + TypeScript) for the frontend.

It allows users to:

âœ… Capture real-time webcam video
âœ… Send frames to the backend for gesture classification
âœ… Display the predicted gesture label (A-Z) with a bounding box overlay
âœ… Support both manual and auto capture (every 5 seconds)
âœ… Backend can run locally, with the ML model stored locally or fetched from Google Drive
